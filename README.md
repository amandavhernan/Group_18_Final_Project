### Project Description

#### API

We used the live crime incidents dataset housed inside Prince George’s County Open Data Portal. The dataset spans a roughly five year period from 2017 to 2022 (present) and is updated weekly. The dataset includes information about the type of incident, when and where the incident was reported, and what reporting area, beat, and sector the incident belongs to.
