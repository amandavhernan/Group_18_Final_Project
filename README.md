### Project Description

#### Target Browsers

* iOS? Android? Which ones? Which versions?

#### API

We used the live crime incidents dataset housed inside Prince George’s County Open Data Portal. The dataset spans a roughly five year period from 2017 to 2022 (present) and is updated weekly. The dataset includes information about the type of incident, when and where the incident was reported, and what reporting area, beat, and sector the incident belongs to.

#### Visualizations

#### JavaScript Libraries & Other Tools

Our project primarily uses Leaflet.js. We also used Tableau to embed a dashboard that houses two additional maps. Another tool we used is Geoapify’s Marker Icon API Playground to create custom markers for our Leaflet.js map. This tool is free and only requires the use of an API key.

#### CSS Frameworks

We used Flexbox to design our site and make it responsive to various screen sizes. 

#### Information Problem

The idea behind the project came from an understanding that some police departments are notorius for releasing skewed or misleading crime statistics. This is an information problem that affects many communities across the United States. This is an issue because crime data may contain inconsistencies that make it easy to misinterpret and spin facts or data in a way that elevates political agendas instead of community-based solutions. Additionally, biased crime data can lead to the spread of harmful stereotypes about certain areas or communities and the people who live there. Our dashboard serves as part of the solution to this information problem by offering users the opportunity to explore crime incidents on a map and view additional details such as where the crime was reported.
