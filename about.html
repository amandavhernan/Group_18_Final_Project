                <p class="text">This student-built safety tracker is a product of the INST377 curriculum at the University of Maryland.
                    The idea behind the project came from an understanding that some police departments are notorius for releasing
                    skewed or misleading crime statistics. This is an information problem that affects many communities across the United States. 
                    This is an issue because crime data may contain inconsistencies that make it easy to misinterpret and spin facts or data in a 
                    way that elevates political agendas instead of community-based solutions. Additionally, biased crime data can lead to the spread 
                    of harmful stereotypes about certain areas or communities and the people who live there.</p>
                <p class="text">To make this project into a reality, we used a publicly available API from the Prince George's County data portal to 
                    extract data from the county's live crime incident dataset. The dataset spans roughly five years from 2017 to 2022 (present). It's 
                    also important to note that the data used to build this dashboard does not represent every call for service handled by the Prince 
                    George's County Police Department. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we built this website to house our 
                    safety tracker. Click on "home" in the header to explore the data.</p>
